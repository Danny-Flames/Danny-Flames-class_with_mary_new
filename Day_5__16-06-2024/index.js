var myName = 'Mary';
const favorite_fruit = 'Apple';
let myAge = '10';

console.log('Hello mary, we are learning javascript.')

// The difference between 'const' and 'let' is that when you declare(create) a variable with the 
// 'const' keyword, it cannot be re-declared but when you declare with a 'let' keyword, it can 
// be re-declared.
