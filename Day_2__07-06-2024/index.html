        <h4>git init</h4>
        <p>
          This command initialises git in your folder. In other words, it
          immediately make that folder to become a local repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running this command will immediately create a '.git' folder in that
          folder. <br />
          What this folder does is that it helps you keep track of all your
          files and the changes made to it.
